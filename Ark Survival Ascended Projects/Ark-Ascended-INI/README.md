# Steamboat Willie Mod (The Mickey Mouse Mod)

## Installation Instructions

1. Download the Steamboat Willie mod (The Mickey Mouse mod).
2. Navigate to the following directory:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ARK Survival Ascended\ShooterGame\Binaries\Win64\ShooterGame\Mods\83374\968851_5285356\
3. Remove all existing content in the folder.

**Note:** Failing to do this will cause the game to crash.
5. Press the cosmetic button once loaded in a server or singleplayer, and you will have no trees or water / beer on official servers.

I created this in July; it was patched but has since been unpatched. Enjoy while it lasts!

### Please make sure you don't hide your cosemtics otherwise the icon for it won't show up and it won't remove the trees / water.

# Update
## This has been patched on official servers as of the newest ark update v54.31 GG
